# Beam
Instant Text and File Transfer using Firebase
## Notes
This is a project that I created to test out some new technologies. It leverages Firebase's Authentication, Realtime Database, and Storage to pass text and files instantly to any computer. This is not meant for long-term storage, but rather an alternative for spamming your own email with data.
## Installation
Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/cavanmflynn/Beam.git` or download the zip.

Create a new [Firebase Web project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

Enable Email & Password Authentication in the Firebase project.

Paste your Firebase Config values into the placeholder section at the top of `index.js`.

You're all set!
